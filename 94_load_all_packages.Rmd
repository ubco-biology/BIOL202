# Load all the necessary packages {-}

This shows you how to load all the packages required for all the tutorials.

If the package is not yet installed, the function will install it for you.

This list of packages avoids the use of the `tidyverse` package, which has been problematic for some.

Each time you start an R session, can copy and paste this code into your console and run it.

Alternatively, if you're working on an assignment, you can copy and past this code into a code chunk at the beginning of your markdown document, and run it.  

```{r all_package_names, message = FALSE}

all.package.names <- c("dplyr", "readr","ggplot2", "tinytex", "skimr", "palmerpenguins", "knitr", "naniar", "janitor", "ggmosaic", "ggExtra", "infer", "binom", "epitools", "car", "broom", "kableExtra", "boot", "here", "gtsummary")

# Now let's load all the packages, first checking if the given package needs installing

# Load the packages using lapply

lapply(all.package.names, function(package) {
  if (!requireNamespace(package, quietly = TRUE)) {
    install.packages(package, dependencies = TRUE)
  }
  library(package, character.only = TRUE)
})
```
