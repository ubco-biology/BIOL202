# Welcome {-}

This is an open source online book that includes all tutorials and other resources for the "lab" portion of the course BIOL202: Introduction to Biostatistics, at the University of British Columbia, Okanagan campus. 

This book is **currently under development, with sections being added weekly**.

## Author {-}

I (Jason Pither) am an Associate Professor in the Department of Biology at the Okanagan campus of the University of British Columbia. I am an ecologist with interests in biogeography, community ecology, and landscape ecology. I have been using "R" (and its [predecessor, "S"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language)#History)) in my  research for over two decades, and have been teaching Introductory Biostatistics using R since 2014.  

## Acknowledgments {-}

I am grateful to be able to live, work, and play on the traditional, ancestral, and unceded territory of the Syilx (Okanagan) people. To find out more about Indigenous territories where you live, consult [https://native-land.ca](https://native-land.ca).
