At its simplest: R is like a car’s engine RStudio is like a car’s dashboard R: Engine RStudio: Dashboard More precisely, R is a programming language that runs computations while RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) that provides an interface by adding many convenient features and tools. So the way of having access to a speedometer, rearview mirrors, and a navigation system makes driving much easier, using RStudio’s interface makes using R much easier as well. "],["install-R-Rstudio.html", "2 Installing R and RStudio", " 2 Installing R and RStudio Note The latest version of R is 4.1.1 (“Kick Things”). It is strongly recommended that you install this latest version, even if you have older versions already installed. However If you have an older operating system on your computer, you’ll want to check compatibility of both R and RStudio. The RStudio website should detect your operating system and provide the appropriate download option automatically. The website with older versions of R is here, and older versions of RStudio is here. Follow the instructions below, and optionally you can view this YouTube video here prior to starting the steps. Download and install both R and RStudio (Desktop version) on your computer. Note R needs to be installed successfully &gt;prior&lt; to installing RStudio (because the latter depends on the former) Figure out what operating system (and version) you have on your computer (e.g. Windows 10; Mac OS X 10.15 “Big Sur”) Go to this website and click on the appropriate download link at the top of the page (depending on your operating system, Windows / MacOS / Linux) For Windows users, download the “base” version; this file will be called something like R-4.1.1-win.exe. Executing this file launches a familiar Windows Setup Wizard that will install R on your computer. For Mac users, download the “pkg” file that is appropriate for your version of MacOS; the file will be called something like R-4.1.1.pkg. Download and run this installation package—just accept the default options and you will be ready to go. Now to install RStudio: once you have installed “R,” go to this website and click on the “download” button in the top right corner, then select the blue button underneath the “RStudio Desktop FREE” column. Then, click on the appropriate link under the “Installers for Supported Platforms” heading; this again depends on what platform / operating system you’re using. It will likely be one of the first two options. "],["start-r.html", "3 Start using R &amp; RStudio", " 3 Start using R &amp; RStudio Recall our car analogy from a previous tutorial. Much as we don’t drive a car by interacting directly with the engine but rather by using elements on the car’s dashboard, we won’t be using R directly but rather we will use RStudio’s interface. After you install R and RStudio on your computer, you’ll have two new programs AKA applications you can open. We will always work in RStudio and not R. In other words: R: Do not open this RStudio: Open this Launch RStudio on your computer to make sure it’s working (it loads R for you in the background).

Over the course of this chapter, you’ll come to learn what purpose each of these panes serves.

"],["packages.html", "4 R packages", " 4 R packages An R package is a collection of functions, data, and documentation that extends the capabilities of R. They are written by a world-wide community of R users. For example, among the most popular packages are: ggplot2 package for data visualization dplyr package for data wrangling tidyverse, which is a package that includes a collection of multiple packages (including the preceding two) that are all installed at once. We’ll be using this package in the course. There are two key things to remember about R packages: Installation: Most packages are not installed by default when you install R and RStudio. You need to install a package before you can use it. Once you’ve installed it, you likely don’t need to install it again unless you want to update it to a newer version of the package. Loading: Packages are not loaded automatically when you open RStudio. You need to load them everytime you open RStudio. "],["package-install.html", "4.1 Package installation", " 4.1 Package installation Let’s install the tidyverse package. There are two ways to install an R package: In the Files pane: Click on “Packages” Click on “Install” Type the name of the package under “Packages (separate multiple with space or comma):” In this case, type tidyverse Click “Install” Alternatively, in the Console pane type the following (NOTE never include this code within your R Markdown document; only install packages by typing directly in the Console): install.packages(&quot;tidyverse&quot;) Note When working on your own computer, you only need to install a package once, unless you want to update an already installed package to the latest version (something you might do every 6 months or so). HOWEVER: If you’re working on a school computer (in a computer lab or in the library), you may need to install packages each session, because local files are deleted daily. If you’re unsure what packages are already installed, consult the “packages” tab in the lower-right RStudio pane when you start up RStudio; installed packages are listed there. "],["package-load.html", "4.2 Package loading", " 4.2 Package loading Let’s load the tidyverse package. After you’ve installed a package, you can now load it using the library() command. For example, to load the tidyverse package, run the following code in the Console pane: library(tidyverse) Note You have to reload each package you want to use every time you open a new session of RStudio. This is a little annoying to get used to and will be your most common error as you begin. When you see an error such as Error: could not find function remember that this likely comes from you trying to use a function in a package that has not been loaded. Remember to run the library() function with the appropriate package to fix this error. "],["intro-markdown.html", "5 Intro to R Markdown", " 5 Intro to R Markdown As you may have learned already from section 6 of the Biology Procedures and Guidelines resource, R Markdown is a markup language that provides an easy way to produce a rich, fully-documented reproducible analysis. It allows its user to share a single file that contains all of the commentary, R code, and metadata needed to reproduce the analysis from beginning to end. R Markdown allows for “chunks” of R code to be included along with Markdown text to produce a nicely formatted HTML, PDF, or Word file without having to know any complicated programming languages or having to fuss with getting the formatting just right in a Microsoft Word DOCX file. One R Markdown file can generate a variety of different formats and all of this is done in a single text file with a few bits of formatting. You’ll be pleasantly surprised at how easy it is to write an R Markdown document after your first few attempts. We will be using R Markdown to create reproducible lab reports. Note R Markdown is just one flavour of a markup language. RStudio can be used to edit R Markdown. There are many other markdown editors out there, but using RStudio is good for our purposes. "],["lit-programming.html", "5.1 Literate programming with R Markdown", " 5.1 Literate programming with R Markdown View the following short video: Why use R Markdown for Lab Reports? The preceding video described what can be referred to as literate programming: authoring a single document that integrates data analysis (executable code) with textual documentation, linking data, code, and text. In R Markdown, the executable R code is placed in “chunks,” and these are embedded throughout sections of regular text. For an example of an HTML (webpage) document that illustrates the effectiveness of literate programming, take a look at this HTML output - a webpage that accompanied a lab-based experiment examining the potential for freshwater diatoms to be successfully dispersed over long distances adhered to duck feathers.

A key functionality we need is being able to “knit” our report to PDF format. For this, we need to install the tinytex package {#install_tinytex}. Copy and paste the following two lines of code into the command console of RStudio (the bottom left window panel), then press return: install.packages(&quot;tinytex&quot;) tinytex::install_tinytex() RStudio will take a minute or two to install a bunch of things. Once it’s done, we’re ready to try knitting to PDF! Reminder Recall you only need to install a package once! And this should be the last time you need to deal with the tinytex package (you won’t need to “load” it in future), because now that it’s installed, its functionality works in the background with RStudio. While in RStudio, select the “+” dropdown icon at top left of RStudio window, and select R Markdown. RStudio may at this point install a bunch of things, and if so that’s ok. A window will then appear and you can replace the “Untitled” with something like “Test,” then select OK. This will open an R Markdown document in the top left panel. Don’t worry about all the text in there at this point. What we want to do is test whether it will “knit” (render) the document to PDF format. To do this: Select the “Knit” drop-down icon near the top left of the RStudio window, and select “Knit to PDF.” RStudio will ask you to first save the markdown file (save it anywhere with any name for now), then it will process the markdown file and render it to PDF. In a future tutorial we’ll discuss how to use R Markdown as part of a reproducible workflow.

In first year you learned from the Biology program’s introductory Open Science learning modules that reproducible research studies are not as common as one might assume. One key reason for this is insufficient documentation of all the steps taken along the research workflow. Moreover, conducting reproducible research is extremely challenging - more than most scientists appreciate. See, for example, an incredible, recent case concerning ageing experiments with C. elegans here. In the BIOL202 lectures you’ll learn more about the various causes of irreproducible research, and about the practices that can help promote reproducibility. In this lab component of the course, you’ll learn the basics of how to achieve an acceptable level of computational reproducibility (complete computational reproducibility is actually pretty tricky, but we’ll get close). "],["comp-repro.html", "7.1 Computational reproducibility", " 7.1 Computational reproducibility Almost all research, whether it’s conducted in the field or in a lab, includes a substantial amount of work that’s done on the computer. This includes data processing, statistical analyses, data visualization and presentation, and production of research outputs (e.g. publications). Some research is of course exclusively conducted on computers. The bottom line is that computer-based work forms a key and substantive part of all research workflows. Given that this work is done on computers (which are entirely controllable), it should be able to be reproduced exactly. This is known as computational reproducibility: an independent researcher should be able to access all data and scripts from a study, run those scripts, and get exactly the same outputs and results as reported in the original study. In this tutorial you’ll start gaining relevant experience and skills by producing a reproducible lab report. Note A workflow refers to the the steps you take when conducting your day-to-day work - say, on a term project, for example. Having a well-designed workflow improves efficiency, and when done right, reproducibility. It includes, for example, how you create, access, and manage files on your computer (or in the cloud). Following best practices for naming and organizing your files and directories on your computer will help ensure that you can spend more time doing the important work, and less time fiddling and trying to remember what you did and where you saved your work. It will also help your future self, when labs and assignments in upper year courses request that you use R and R Markdown for analyses and reports. Review the Biology department’s Procedures and Guidelines webpage description of how to manage files and directories. This should take about 20 minutes "],["biol202-workflow.html", "8 An example BIOL202 workflow", " 8 An example BIOL202 workflow Now that you have reviewed the fundamentals of file and directory management, you should decide how to best organize and manage the work you do for BIOL202. Here we’ll provide one example approach that most if not all of you will find useful. "],["onedrive.html", "8.1 Microsoft OneDrive", " 8.1 Microsoft OneDrive Our suggested approach assumes you have set up a Microsoft account through UBC (using your CWL), and have set up the OneDrive application on your own computer, which automatically syncs (when you’re online) selected files/directories between your local computer and your OneDrive account in the cloud. Why OneDrive? As a UBC student, you receive 1TB of free storage! And you also get peace of mind knowing that your files are secure and up-to-date (provided you have an internet connection), and that OneDrive has something called “version control,” which saves old versions of files and allows you to see those versions if you wish, so long as you maintain the same file name. WAIT A SECOND! In the “File Naming” instructions that I just reviewed, I was instructed to create a new file with a new version number in the filename (e.g. with a “V0,” “V1,” “V2” etc…) each time I worked on it! Those instructions are entirely valid! However, when you have access to a version control system, like OneDrive, it is better to keep the file name the same, rather than changing it each time you update it. For example, your markdown file (which as a “.Rmd” extension to the name) that you use for your tutorial work should maintain the same name throughout the term, rather than saving a new file each time you do substantive work on it. Assuming your files are syncing properly between your computer and OneDrive (and this simply requires that you’re connected to the internet), you will always be able to see (and if desired, restore) old versions of your files. If you haven’t set up OneDrive yet, follow the instructions provided at this UBC IT website. Note Using OneDrive is entirely optional. If you choose not to use OneDrive, please follow the file naming instructions from the Procedures and Guidelines document. And you can still follow the directory structure instructions below, regardless of where you set up your directories (OneDrive or not). "],["dir-structure.html", "8.2 Directory structure", " 8.2 Directory structure We anticipate three general categories of work being undertaken: Lecture work, including annotating lecture notes (e.g. on PDFs or PowerPoints) and writing study notes of your own (e.g. using Word) Tutorial work, including practicing what you learn in tutorials using RStudio and R Markdown, and commenting about tips, or tricky bits Lab assignment work, in which you answer questions using R and R Markdown and create a document for submission and grading Each of these categories of work should have their own directory, and all three of these directories should exist within a “root” directory called “BIOL202.” "],["setup-dirs.html", "8.3 Steps to set up directories", " 8.3 Steps to set up directories Having successfully installed OneDrive, you should see a “OneDrive” folder on your computer In your OneDrive folder, create a root directory “BIOL202” to host all of your BIOL202 work Create a \"_README.txt file for the root BIOL202 directory, as per instructions in the Biology Procedures and Guidelines webpage. TIP You can create and edit your \"_README.txt\" file in RStudio! Just click on the “+” drop down at the top left, and select “Text file.” Then type in the information you need, and name it \"_README.txt\" and save it in the appropriate directory. Within the BIOL202 root directory, create three (sub)directories: “BIOL202_lecture” “BIOL202_tutorials” “BIOL202_assignments” Create a \"_README.txt\" file in each of the three sub-directories (again, you can use RStudio to create these!) The BIOL202 directory, and all its contents, will now sync regularly to your online OneDrive account, so that you can access your up-to-date files from any device upon which OneDrive is installed.

The instructions provided below create an RStudio project in the “BIOL202_tutorials” directory (see below), and then create a single R Markdown document, formatted to have sections (headers) for each tutorial you work on. This approach makes it easier to find all of your work in the R Markdown file, so long as it is formatted logically. I have created an R Markdown file that you can download and use for this purpose, and we’ll download that a bit later. First, we need to set up an RStudio project. "],["create-project.html", "8.6 Create an RStudio Project", " 8.6 Create an RStudio Project It is best to organize all your R work using RStudio “projects.” For your tutorial work, for example, you will create a new project that will be housed in your “BIOL202_tutorials” directory To do this, open RStudio then select File &gt; New Project. Then select the option to use an existing directory, and locate and select your tutorial directory. Provide a name for your project file, such as “BIOL202_tutorial,” then select OK. If it asks to open a new RStudio session, you can say yes. RStudio has now created an RStudio project file that has an “Rproj” extension at the end of the name. This “Rproj” file is the file that you will open (double-click with the mouse) each time you wish to work on your tutorial material. You should see the “Rproj” file in the bottom right files panel of RStudio. "],["create-subdirs.html", "8.7 Create subdirectories", " 8.7 Create subdirectories Your tutorial work may involve creating and saving outputs like figures or files, in which case you should have sub-directories for these purposes in your root directory. See the example provided in the Procedures and Guidelines document. Let’s illustrate the procedure by creating a subdirectory called “figures,” and this time we’ll use R to create the directory. Updated 7:15pm Sept 9 The following code will create a directory called “figures” in your working directory dir.create(&quot;figures&quot;) You should see the new folder appear in the files panel on the bottom right of RStudio. Whenever you wish to generate figures in R, then export them as image files, for example, you can save them to this folder. We’ll learn about this later. Reading and writing files from / to directories requires that we can tell R exactly where to find those directories. That’s where the handy package called here comes in. 8.7.1 The here package Now we’ll install and load an R package called here that will help with file and directory management and navigation. install.packages(&quot;here&quot;) This is a helpful blog post about the utility of the here package. Then we load the package: library(here) When you load the package, the here function takes stock of where your RStudio project file is located, and establishes that directory as the “working directory.” It should return a file path for you. In future tutorials we’ll make use of the here package when saving files.

You can insert as many chunks as you’d like. Chunk insertion is achieved by selecting the green “+” icon at top of the editor panel, and selecting “R.” Or go to the “Code” menu drop down and “Insert Chunk.” The key advice: keep your work organized by using headings.

You might recall reading about Markdown in the Biology Procedures and Guidelines document. Make sure you save the Rmd file into your root “BIOL202_assignments” directory, or alternatively into the appropriate sub-directory. A practice assignment has been set up on Canvas, so that you can get used to this procedure. It is located under “Lab_materials” module.

"],["what-include-answer.html", "9.4 What to include in your answers", " 9.4 What to include in your answers The general approach is to enter your text answers and associated R chunks with code underneath each question. Tip It is almost always the case that you’ll need to load the tidyverse package, so it’s advisable to include an R chunk right at the beginning of your document that does this. Tip To insert a new code chunk, you can either: Use the shortcut: Mac = Command+Option+I; Windows = Ctrl+Alt+I. Click on the Insert a new code chunk icon. You can also specify the coding language of the chunk using the drop-down menu. 9.4.1 Code chunk headers Here’s an example code chunk in which the tidyverse package is being loaded. You’ll notice some extra text in the header of the chunk. Figure 9.2: Code chunk header with message suppression The “load_packages” text is simply giving a name or “tag” to this R chunk. It is good practice to provide a unique name to each R chunk. After the comma is message = FALSE. This tells R markdown to NOT display any messages associated with the R commands in this chunk when knitting the R Markdown document. For example, when loading some libraries R will provide a long list of messages in the process. When you “knit” the R Markdown document, R will run each R chunk in your document. By including the message = FALSE heading argument, you can avoid including this extra output in your knitted document. There will be routine steps to take for each question. Import data Each assignment question will indicate which dataset(s) you’ll need to answer the question, and where to locate / download these. In many instances multiple questions will use the same dataset, in which case you don’t need to load data for each question; just load it once. Here’s an example of code for importing data. It uses the read_csv function from the readr package, which is bundled with the tidyverse package: example_data &lt;- read_csv(&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ubco-biology/BIOL202/main/data/example_data.csv&quot;) The read_csv function will take as an argument a URL address for a data file. Here we’ve provided a ULR for the location of a CSV file (comma-separated values file), which is typically what we’ll use. Load packages Once you’ve loaded the data, you’ll now need to figure out how to answer the question by looking through the tutorials for the answer. And typically, to answer the question you’ll need to make sure you’ve loaded some packages. If you’ve forgotten what “packages” are, refresh your memory at this tutorial. For example, it’s likely you’ve already loaded the tidyverse package (as advised above), but if a tutorial indicates you need another package, say the janitor package, then insert a code chunk with the following: library(janitor) REMINDER When working on your own computer, you only need to install a package once (unless you want to update an already installed package to the latest version, which is a rare event). If you’re working on a school computer (in a computer lab), you may need to install packages each time you log on to a computer, because the school computers delete local files daily. If you’re unsure what packages are already installed, consult the “packages” tab in the lower-right RStudio pane when you start up RStudio; installed packages are listed there. Answer the questions After you’ve imported the required data and loaded required packages, it’s time to answer the questions! You simply insert any required text and R code (in R Chunks) after each question. The tutorials will provide the information required to answer the questions. TIP The way to test out your code once it’s inserted in the R chunk is to press the green play button at the top right of the code chunk. This will run what’s in the chunk. You’ll be provided error statements if something goes wrong. If it works, it will provide you the output (and hopefully the answer!), and this is what you use to inform your written (typed) answer. Here’s what you need to include in your answers: Answer each question clearly and in full sentences. Make sure you answer specifically the question asked. Verify that the code you used to answer the question is included in an R chunk and appears in the knitted document (this should happen automatically) Verify that the output from each R chunk is included in your knitted document (this should happen automatically) For any figures (graphs) that you produce, you must include a figure caption. See the next section for instructions. If you use a graph to answer a question, refer to that graph in your answer REMINDER As you work on your document, save frequently, and also knit your document frequently. TIP You will often need/want to preview the document you are working on to ensure that everything is being formatted as you expected in the knitting process. The default setting is for the preview to open in a new pop-up window outside of RStudio, although you may find it useful to have it open in the Viewer panel within RStudio itself (particularly if you’re only working with one screen!). To change the preview location, click the Settings icon in the toolbar and select the option to “Preview in Viewer Pane.” "],["rmd-graphing.html", "9.5 Setting up R Markdown for graphing", " 9.5 Setting up R Markdown for graphing There are some special code chunk header arguments that need to be set in your Markdown document in order to: include proper Figure captions with your figures (a necessity!) set the dimensions of your figures In each code chunk that includes code to construct a graph, your chunk header options should look like this in the top of the chunk, and there should be one blank line underneath before the main code starts. The following chunk produced the figure below. And recall that in the example below, the “bill_fig” text is simply the name I’ve given to this code chunk. Figure 1: Histogram of bill depth among 151 Adelie penguins The key parts are the “fig.cap =” argument, to which you provide the text you want to use as the figure caption. Then there’s the “fig.width =” and “fig.height =” arguments, which indicate the size of the figure when knitted. This will likely require some trial-and-error to get a good size, but start with the values in this example (4 for each). Automated figure numbering When you knit the document to PDF, you’ll see the “Figure X:” (with a number in place of the “X”) text was appended at the beginning of the caption phrase that was included in the chunk header, “Histogram of bill depth among 151 Adelie penguins.” This feature - automatic figure numbering - was set within the header of the assignment markdown document: Figure 9.3: Assignment markdown file header with figure caption option The line “fig_caption = true” tells R Markdown and the knitting process to automatically include this part of a figure caption, “Figure X,” underneath each figure you produce. Where “X” will automatically be replaced with the appropriate number. For example, it will use “Figure 1:” for your first figure, “Figure 2” for your second, and so on. "],["example-answer.html", "9.6 Example question / answer", " 9.6 Example question / answer Below is an example of how to answer a question. NOTE There are almost always multiple coding approaches to get the right answer, some better than others. As long as your code and answer are accurate and make sense, you’ll get the marks! Question 1. What are the minimum and maximum heights (variable name is “height_cm”) of students in the “students” dataset, which is available at this URL: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ubco-biology/BIOL202/main/data/students2.csv As we learned in the [fictitious] “importing and exploring data” tutorial, I can use the read_csv function from the readr package (loaded with tidyverse) to download and import the dataset. It creates a “tibble” object, which here I name “students”: students &lt;- read_csv(&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ubco-biology/BIOL202/main/data/students.csv&quot;) I also learned that it’s a good idea to get an overview of the dataset as a first step after importing data. To do this, use the skim_without_charts function from the skimr package.

We can use the summary function to get some basic descriptive statistics, including the minimum and maximum of numeric variables. The summary function is part of the base R package, so no additional packages need to be loaded. We also use the select function from the dplyr package (which is loaded with tidyverse) to select which variable in the students tibble we wish to summarize. The use of the “%&gt;%” syntax is described in another tutorial (yet to be posted!). summary.height &lt;- students %&gt;% select(height_cm) %&gt;% summary summary.height ## height_cm ## Min. :150.0 ## 1st Qu.:165.0 ## Median :171.5 ## Mean :172.0 ## 3rd Qu.:180.0 ## Max. :210.8 As shown in the output above, the minimum height was 150.0 cm and the maximum student height was 210.8 cm. TIP You’ll note that functions and package names above are highlighted in grey. When writing in markdown, it’s good practice to encompass function names and package names in single backticks, i.e.`tidyverse`.

Here, you’ll learn (or review) how to format your own data files according to best practices, so that you or others will have no problems importing them. It is assumed that if you are collecting data during a project, you’ll likely enter them on your computer using a spreadsheet software program like Excel. PAUSE Before starting any data collection and data-entry, ask yourself: how should I organize the spreadsheet for data-entry? The short answer: according to TIDY formatting principles… "],["tidy-data.html", "10.1 Tidy data", " 10.1 Tidy data Review the Biology Procedures and Guidelines document chapter on Tidy data. There you’ll learn how to arrange and format your data within a spreadsheet. The “Tidy” example provided would look like this in Excel: Figure 10.1: Tidy data in Excel Deeper Dive: Optional If you’d like a longer, more in-depth read about “tidy data,” see Hadley Wickham’s “R for Datascience” online book, linked here. And this article describes why making your data “tidy” saves a lot of time and effort in the long run. Oh, and it uses Covid-19 data to demonstrate! If you wish to import and analyze data that have not been formatted according to tidy principles, then the most transparent and computationally reproducible way to reformat the data is to do so by coding within R, rather than using software like Excel. The process of reformatting / rearranging data is called data wrangling, and is mostly beyond the scope of this course. If you’re curious about data wrangling, the dplyr package, which is loaded with the tidyverse package, provides all the tools for data wrangling. Its associated cheatsheet is available here. "],["import-csv-url.html", "10.2 Import a CSV file from a website", " 10.2 Import a CSV file from a website In previous tutorials we’ve already seen how to import CSV files from the web. As always, the first step is to load the tidyverse library, because it includes many packages and functions that are handy for both data import and data wrangling. library(tidyverse) One package that is loaded with the tidyverse package is readr, which includes the handy read_csv function. You can view the help file for the read_csv function by typing this into your command console pane (bottom left) in RStudio: ?read_csv You’ll see that the function has many optional “arguments,” but in general we can use the default values for these. If the file you wish to import is located on the web, then we need to provide the “URL” (the web address) to the read_csv function. For example, in Tutorial 9 section 6 you imported the “students.csv” dataset from the course GitHub website, as follows: students &lt;- read_csv(&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ubco-biology/BIOL202/main/data/students.csv&quot;) ## ## ── Column specification ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── ## cols( ## height_cm = col_double(), ## head_circum_cm = col_double(), ## Sex = col_character(), ## Number_of_siblings = col_double(), ## Dominant_hand = col_character(), ## Dominant_foot = col_character(), ## Dominant_eye = col_character() ## ) Note that the URL address is provided in double quotation marks. This code imports the data and stores it in a local object called “students.” The object is called a “tibble,” which you can think of as a special kind of spreadsheet. More information on “tibbles” can be found here. NOTE Unless otherwise indicated, all CSV data files that we use in this course are stored at the same URL location, specifically: “https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ubco-biology/BIOL202/main/data/.” Thus, to import any CSV file you just need to copy that path, then append the appropriate file name to the end of the path. For example, the full path to access a CSV file called birds.csv file would be “https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ubco-biology/BIOL202/main/data/birds.csv.” Often you’ll need to import data from a locally stored CSV file, rather than from the web. You’ll learn how to do this shortly. First: how does one create a CSV file? "],["create-csv-local.html", "10.3 Create a CSV file", " 10.3 Create a CSV file Before we create or save any data files on our local computer, we should first create a directory (folder) called “rawdata” to store them. Let’s create the new directory in our “BIOL202_tutorials” working directory. To do this, use the dir.create function in R, as follows: dir.create(&quot;rawdata&quot;) Once you run this code, you’ll see the new directory appear in the Files pane in the bottom-right of RStudio. It might look something like this: Figure 10.2: View of files with rawdata folder NOTE The folder is called “rawdata” because the data stored there will be the unedited, raw version of the data, and any files therein should NOT be altered. Any changes or edits one makes to the datasets should be saved in new data files that are saved in a different folder called “output,” which we’ll create later. Let’s create a data file to work with. Steps to create and save a CSV file Open up Excel or any other spreadsheet software and enter values in the spreadsheet cells exactly as shown in the Excel example in Figure 10.1 from the Tidy Data section above You should have one row with the 3 variable names (“Site,” “Day,” “Trout_Caught”), one in each column, then nine rows of data Save the file as a CSV file by selecting (MAC) File &gt; Save As &gt; and in the drop down list: CSV UTF-8 (Comma separated), and Windows File &gt; Save as type &gt; CSV UTF-8 (comma separated) Name it “trout.csv,” and save it within the newly created “rawdata” folder Now we’re ready to try importing the data into a “tibble.” "],["import-csv-local.html", "10.4 Import a local CSV file", " 10.4 Import a local CSV file You can find additional help on importing different types of files at the Data Import Cheat Sheet. Steps to import a local CSV file We’ll use the “trout.csv” file that we created previously. And we’ll make use of the here package that we were introduced to in an earlier tutorial. Let’s load the package: library(here) New tool In brief, pipes allow us to string together a series of functions. Here we’ll use a pipe to help import the data file. Let’s see the code first, then explain after: trout &lt;- here(&quot;rawdata&quot;, &quot;trout.csv&quot;) %&gt;% read_csv() First we have the name of the object (a “tibble”) that we wish to create, “trout.” Then you see the assignment operator “&lt;-,” which tells R to assign whatever we’re doing to the right of the operator to the object “trout.” Then we have the here function, which is taking two inputs: the name of the directory we wish to get something from (“rawdata”), and then the name of the file we wish to do something with, here “trout.csv”). Then we have a pipe “%&gt;%,” which tells R that we’re not done coding yet - there’s more to come on the next line… Lastly, we use the read_csv function, whatever came before the pipe is what is fed to the read_csv function. Go ahead and run the chunk of code above to create the “trout” object. Next we’ll learn how to get an overview of the data stored in a tibble object. "],["data-overview.html", "10.5 Get an overview of a dataset", " 10.5 Get an overview of a dataset When you import data it is always a good idea to immediately get an overview of the data. Key questions you want to be able to answer are: How many variables (columns) are there in the dataset? How many observations (rows) are in the dataset? Are there variables whose data are categorical? If so, which ones? Are there variables whose data are numerical? If so, which ones? Are there observations missing anywhere? As we learned in the “Preparing and formatting assignments” tutorial, the skimr package has a handy function called skim_without_charts that provides a good overview of a data object. This is a rather long function name, and in fact the main function is called skim. However, by default, skim includes small charts in its output, and we don’t want that presently, hence the use of skim_without_charts. Let’s load that package now: library(skimr) And get an overview of the trout dataset: skim_without_charts(trout) Table 10.1: Data summary Name trout Number of rows 9 Number of columns 3 _______________________ Column type frequency: character 1 numeric 2 ________________________ Group variables None Variable type: character skim_variable n_missing complete_rate min max empty n_unique whitespace Site 0 1 10 12 0 3 0 Variable type: numeric skim_variable n_missing complete_rate mean sd p0 p25 p50 p75 p100 Day 0 1 2.00 0.87 1 1 2 3 3 Trout_Caught 0 1 2.78 1.79 0 1 3 4 5 A lot of information is provided in this summary output, so let’s go through it: The Data Summary shows the name of the object, the number of rows, and the number of columns Column type frequency shows how many columns (variables) are of type “character,” which is equivalent to “categorical,” and how many are “numeric” Group variables shows if there are any variables that are specified as “grouping” variables, something we don’t cover yet. Then it provides summaries of each of the variables, starting with the character or categorical variables, followed by the numeric variables Each summary includes a variety of descriptors, described next The “n_missing” descriptor tells you how many observations are missing in the given variable. In the “trout” dataset we don’t have any missing values The “n_unique” descriptor for categorical variables indicates how many unique values (categories) are in that variable; for the “Site” variable in the “trout” dataset there are 3 unique values The descriptors for the numeric variables include the mean, standard deviation (sd), and the quantiles Now you have what you need to answer each of the questions listed above! One additional function that is useful during the overview stage is head. This function just gives you a view of the first 6 rows of the dataset: head(trout) ## # A tibble: 6 x 3 ## Site Day Trout_Caught ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 Mabel-lake 1 1 ## 2 Mabel-lake 2 3 ## 3 Mabel-lake 3 3 ## 4 Postill-lake 1 3 ## 5 Postill-lake 2 4 ## 6 Postill-lake 3 5 When you use head on a “tibble,” like we have here, it outputs another “tibble,” in this case 6 rows by 3 columns.

First: Create a new R Markdown document for this practice activity. This is where you’ll record the procedures you use for this practice activity As we’ve learned in previous tutorials, one of the first steps we should do is include a code chunk in the markdown document in which we load any packages we’ll need. Include a code chunk to load the packages used in the present tutorial Save the R Markdown document in your root “BIOL202_tutorials” directory, and provide it an appropriate file name. Open a new blank spreadsheet in Excel Note Before taking the measurements, think about how you can make your measurement procedure reproducible. Where exactly are you measuring from and to on each digit? Are you using a ruler? What’s your measurement precision? Whatever approach you take, make sure you type it out clearly in your R Markdown document, so that someone else could repeat it. Also before you start measuring, think about how you’ll organize the data in the spreadsheet, including how many variables you’ll have, what to name those variables, and how many rows or observations you’ll have. HINT: Even before you start measuring, most of your data sheet should be filled with values, and when you type in your 6 measurements, these should be entered in a single column. Once you’ve organized the spreadsheet, and even before you start entering the digit measurements, save it as a CSV file into your “rawdata” folder, remembering to use an appropriate file name Once you’ve typed out the methods in your markdown document, you can start taking measurements and recording them in the spreadsheet Once you’ve finished entering the data, save the spreadsheet again, then quit Excel.

It’s better to take a small peek at the data with head. In a previous tutorial you learned the important information to look for when getting an overview of a dataset using the skim_without_charts function. TIP It’s important to check whether there are any missing values for any of the variables in your dataset. In the penguins dataset, you’ll see that there are 344 cases (rows), but (as an example) there are 2 missing values for each of the 4 morphometric variables, including body mass. You need to take note of this so that you report the correct sample sizes in any table or figure captions! Once you have gotten an overview your dataset’s structure and contents, the next order of business is always to visualize your data using graphs and sometimes tables. Following instructions provided in previous tutorials, import the tigerdeaths.csv and birds.csv datasets, and get an overview of each of those datasets. "],["vis-cat-freq-table.html", "11.3 Create a frequency table", " 11.3 Create a frequency table Sometimes when the aim is to visualize a single categorical variable, it’s useful to present a frequency table. If your variable has more than, say, 10 unique categories, then this approach can be messy, and instead one should solely create a bar graph, as described in the next section. Many straightforward operations like tabulation and calculating descriptive statistics can be done using the functionality of the dplyr package (see the cheatsheet here), which gets loaded as part of the tidyverse suite of packages. Here, we’ll use this functionality to create a frequency table for a categorical variable. We’ll demonstrate this using the tigerdeaths.csv dataset that you should have imported as part of a suggested activity in the previous section, using code like this: tigerdeaths &lt;- read_csv(&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ubco-biology/BIOL202/main/data/tigerdeaths.csv&quot;) You would also have gotten overview of the data as part of the activity, using the skim_without_charts function. This would have shown that the activity variable is of type “character,” which tells us it is a categorical variable, and that it includes 9 unique categories. We also would have seen that there are 88 cases (rows) in the dataset. Let’s provide the code to generate the frequency table, using the pipes “%&gt;%” approach we learned about in an earlier tutorial. We’ll assign the output to a new object that will hold the frequency table. We’ll name the object “tiger.table.” Note that we won’t yet view the table here… we’ll do that next. We’ll provide the code first, then explain it step-by-step after. Here’s the code for creating the frequency table and assigning it to a new object named “tiger.table”: tiger.table &lt;- tigerdeaths %&gt;% count(activity, sort = TRUE) %&gt;% mutate(relative_frequency = n / sum(n)) The first line provides the name of the object (tibble) that we’re going to create (here, “tiger.table”), and use the assignment operator (“&lt;-”) tell R to put whatever the output of our operation is into that object. The next part of the first line provides the name of the object that we’re going to do something with, here “tigerdeaths.” The “%&gt;%” tells R that we’re not done yet, and there’s more lines of code to come. The second line uses the count function from the dplyr package to tally the unique values of a variable, in this case the “activity” variable. It also takes an argument “sort = TRUE,” telling it to sort the counts in descending order (the default sort direction). Then another “%&gt;%” to continue the code.. The last line uses mutate function from the dplyr package that creates a new variable, and the arguments provided in the parentheses tells R what that variable should be called, here “relative_frequency,” and then how to calculate it. The n in the last line actually a function that tallies the sample size or count of all observations in the present category or group, and then the sum(n) sums up the total sample size. Thus, n / sum(n) calculates the relative frequency (equivalent to the proportion) of all observations that are within the given category Optional Try figuring out how you would change the last line of code in the chunk above so that the table showed the percent rather than the relative frequency of observations in each category Now that we’ve created the frequency table, let’s have a look at it. In a supplementary tutorial, you’ll find instructions on how to create nicely formatted tables for output with appropriate captions. For now, let’s go ahead and use the kable function that comes with the knitr package: kable(tiger.table, caption = &quot;Frequency table showing the activities of 88 people at the time they were attacked and killed by tigers near Chitwan national Park, Nepal, from 1979 to 2006&quot;, digits = 3) (#tab:vis1_kable_tiger)Frequency table showing the activities of 88 people at the time they were attacked and killed by tigers near Chitwan national Park, Nepal, from 1979 to 2006 activity n relative_frequency Grass/fodder 44 0.500 Forest products 11 0.125 Fishing 8 0.091 Herding 7 0.080 Disturbing tiger kill 5 0.057 Fuelwood/timber 5 0.057 Sleeping in house 3 0.034 Walking 3 0.034 Toilet 2 0.023 Notice that this produces a nicely formatted table with an appropriately worded caption. The argument “digits = 3” tells it to return numeric values to 3 digits in the table. You now know how to create a frequency table for a categorical variable! Try creating a frequency table using the birds dataset, which includes data about four types of birds observed at a wetland. "],["vis-cat-barchart.html", "11.4 Create a bar graph", " 11.4 Create a bar graph We use a bar graph to visualize the frequency distribution for a single categorical variable. We’ll use the ggplot approach with its geom_bar function to create a bar graph. The ggplot function comes with the ggplot2 package, which itself is loaded as part of the tidyverse. To produce the bar graph, we use a frequency table as the input. Thus, we’ll use the “tiger.table” object from above. Recall that the “tiger.table” is a sort of summary presentation of the “activity” variable: it shows the total counts (frequencies) of individuals in each of the nine “activity” categories. And although in the code chunk below you’ll see that we provide an “x” and a “y” variable for creating the graph, remember that we’re really only visualizing a single categorical variable. Let’s provide the code first, and explain after. ggplot(data = tiger.table, aes(x = reorder(activity, n), y = n)) + geom_bar(stat = &quot;identity&quot;) + ylab(&quot;Frequency&quot;) + xlab(&quot;Activity&quot;) + coord_flip() + theme_bw() (#fig:vis1_bargraph)Bar graph showing the activities of 88 people at the time they were attached and killed by tigers near Chitwan national Park, Nepal, from 1979 to 2006 All figures produced using the ggplot2 package start with the ggplot function. Then the following arguments: The tibble (or dataframe) that holds the data (“data = tiger.table”) An “aes” argument (which stands for “aesthetics”), within which one specifies the variables to be plotted; here we’re plotting the frequencies from the “n” variable in the frequency table as the “y” variable, and the “activity” categorical variable as the “x” variable. To ensure the proper sorting of the bars, we use the reorder function, telling R to reorder the activity categories according to the frequencies in the n variable Then there’s a plus sign to tell ggplot we’re not done yet with our graph - there are more functions coming (think of it as ggplot’s version of the “pipe”) Then the type of graph, which uses a function starting with “geom”; here we want a bar graph, hence geom_bar The geom_bar function has its own argument: “stat = ‘identity’” tells it just to make the height of the bars equal to the values provided in the “y” variable, here n. The ylab function sets the y-axis label The xlab function sets the x-axis label The coord_flip function tells it to rotate the graph horizontally; this makes it easier to fit the activity labels on the graph Then the theme_bw function indicates we want a simple black-and-white theme There you have it: a nicely formatted bar graph! REMINDER Don’t forget to include a good figure caption! Here’s a snapshot of the full code chunk that produced the bar graph above: (#fig:vis1_barcode_example)Example code chunk for producing a good bar graph Try creating a bar graph using the birds dataset, which includes data about four types of birds observed at a wetland. "],["vis-histogram.html", "11.5 Create a histogram", " 11.5 Create a histogram A histogram uses the area of rectangular bars to display the frequency distribution (or relative frequency distribution) of a numerical variable. We’ll use ggplot to create a histogram, and we’ll again use the penguins dataset. We’ll give the code first, then explain below: ggplot(data = penguins, aes(x = body_mass_g)) + geom_histogram(colour = &quot;black&quot;, fill = &quot;lightgrey&quot;) + xlab(&quot;Body mass (g)&quot;) + ylab(&quot;Frequency&quot;) + theme_bw() ## `stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`. (#fig:vis1_hist_penguins)Histogram of body mass (g) for 342 penguins The syntax follows what was seen above when creating a bar graph, but: Here we have only a single variable “x” variable, body_mass_g to provide the aes function. We use the geom_histogram function, which has its own optional arguments: the “color” we want the outlines of each bar in the histogram to be the “fill” colour we want the bars to be You can also specify the “bin width” that geom_histogram uses when generating the histogram. Notice above that we got a message stating: ## `stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`. It’s telling us that there’s probably a better bin width to use. The trick is to not have to small a bin width, such that you end up with too many bars in your histogram (giving too much detail in the frequency distribution), and to not have too large a bin width such that you have too few bars in your histogram (giving too little detail). Looking at the previous histogram, we could try using a bid width of 500 g. We need to add the argument “binwidth” to the geom_histogram function, as follows: ggplot(data = penguins, aes(x = body_mass_g)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 500, colour = &quot;black&quot;, fill = &quot;lightgrey&quot;) + xlab(&quot;Body mass (g)&quot;) + ylab(&quot;Frequency&quot;) + theme_bw() (#fig:vis1_hist_penguins1)Histogram of body mass (g) for 342 penguins Hmm, that is lumping the data too much, and not giving enough detail about the distribution. Let’s try a bin width of 250 g: ggplot(data = penguins, aes(x = body_mass_g)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 250, colour = &quot;black&quot;, fill = &quot;lightgrey&quot;) + xlab(&quot;Body mass (g)&quot;) + ylab(&quot;Frequency&quot;) + theme_bw() (#fig:vis1_hist_penguins2)Histogram of body mass (g) for 342 penguins That’s much better! "],["describing-a-histogram-vis-describe-hist.html", "11.6 Describing a histogram (#vis_describe_hist)", " 11.6 Describing a histogram (#vis_describe_hist) Things to note in your description of a histogram: Is it roughly symmetric or is it negatively or positively skewed? Is it roughly bell-shaped? Outliers - are there observations (bars) showing up far from the others? Are there multiple modes? So, let’s look again at the penguin body mass histogram, and provide a description thereafter: ggplot(data = penguins, aes(x = body_mass_g)) + geom_histogram(binwidth = 250, colour = &quot;black&quot;, fill = &quot;lightgrey&quot;) + xlab(&quot;Body mass (g)&quot;) + ylab(&quot;Frequency&quot;) + theme_bw() (#fig:vis1_hist_penguins3)Histogram of body mass (g) for 342 penguins The histogram is moderately positively skewed, with a major mode near 3500g, and some smaller modes near 4700 and 5500 g. There are no apparent outliers. Create a histogram of the bill lengths of penguins in the penguins dataset, and include an appropriate figure caption.
