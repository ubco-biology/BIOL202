At its simplest: R is like a car’s engine RStudio is like a car’s dashboard R: Engine RStudio: Dashboard More precisely, R is a programming language that runs computations while RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) that provides an interface by adding many convenient features and tools. So the way of having access to a speedometer, rearview mirrors, and a navigation system makes driving much easier, using RStudio’s interface makes using R much easier as well. "],["install-R-Rstudio.html", "2 Installing R and RStudio", " 2 Installing R and RStudio Note The latest version of R is 4.1.1 (“Kick Things”). It is strongly recommended that you install this latest version, even if you have older versions already installed. However If you have an older operating system on your computer, you’ll want to check compatibility of both R and RStudio. The RStudio website should detect your operating system and provide the appropriate download option automatically. The website with older versions of R is here, and older versions of RStudio is here. Follow the instructions below, and optionally you can view this YouTube video here prior to starting the steps. Download and install both R and RStudio (Desktop version) on your computer. Note R needs to be installed successfully &gt;prior&lt; to installing RStudio (because the latter depends on the former) Figure out what operating system (and version) you have on your computer (e.g. Windows 10; Mac OS X 10.15 “Big Sur”) Go to this website and click on the appropriate download link at the top of the page (depending on your operating system, Windows / MacOS / Linux) For Windows users, download the “base” version; this file will be called something like R-4.1.1-win.exe. Executing this file launches a familiar Windows Setup Wizard that will install R on your computer. For Mac users, download the “pkg” file that is appropriate for your version of MacOS; the file will be called something like R-4.1.1.pkg. Download and run this installation package—just accept the default options and you will be ready to go. Now to install RStudio: once you have installed “R,” go to this website and click on the “download” button in the top right corner, then select the blue button underneath the “RStudio Desktop FREE” column. Then, click on the appropriate link under the “Installers for Supported Platforms” heading; this again depends on what platform / operating system you’re using. It will likely be one of the first two options. "],["start-r.html", "3 Start using R &amp; RStudio", " 3 Start using R &amp; RStudio Recall our car analogy from a previous tutorial. Much as we don’t drive a car by interacting directly with the engine but rather by using elements on the car’s dashboard, we won’t be using R directly but rather we will use RStudio’s interface. After you install R and RStudio on your computer, you’ll have two new programs AKA applications you can open. We will always work in RStudio and not R. In other words: R: Do not open this RStudio: Open this Launch RStudio on your computer to make sure it’s working (it loads R for you in the background).

Over the course of this chapter, you’ll come to learn what purpose each of these panes serves.

"],["packages.html", "4 R packages", " 4 R packages An R package is a collection of functions, data, and documentation that extends the capabilities of R. They are written by a world-wide community of R users. For example, among the most popular packages are: ggplot2 package for data visualization dplyr package for data wrangling tidyverse, which is a package that includes a collection of multiple packages (including the preceding two) that are all installed at once. We’ll be using this package in the course. There are two key things to remember about R packages: Installation: Most packages are not installed by default when you install R and RStudio. You need to install a package before you can use it. Once you’ve installed it, you likely don’t need to install it again unless you want to update it to a newer version of the package. Loading: Packages are not loaded automatically when you open RStudio. You need to load them everytime you open RStudio. "],["package-install.html", "4.1 Package installation", " 4.1 Package installation Let’s install the tidyverse package. There are two ways to install an R package: In the Files pane: Click on “Packages” Click on “Install” Type the name of the package under “Packages (separate multiple with space or comma):” In this case, type tidyverse Click “Install” Alternatively, in the Console pane type the following (NOTE never include this code within your R Markdown document; only install packages by typing directly in the Console): install.packages(&quot;tidyverse&quot;) Note When working on your own computer, you only need to install a package once, unless you want to update an already installed package to the latest version (something you might do every 6 months or so). HOWEVER: If you’re working on a school computer (in a computer lab or in the library), you may need to install packages each session, because local files are deleted daily. If you’re unsure what packages are already installed, consult the “packages” tab in the lower-right RStudio pane when you start up RStudio; installed packages are listed there. "],["package-load.html", "4.2 Package loading", " 4.2 Package loading Let’s load the tidyverse package. After you’ve installed a package, you can now load it using the library() command. For example, to load the tidyverse package, run the following code in the Console pane: library(tidyverse) Note You have to reload each package you want to use every time you open a new session of RStudio. This is a little annoying to get used to and will be your most common error as you begin. When you see an error such as Error: could not find function remember that this likely comes from you trying to use a function in a package that has not been loaded. Remember to run the library() function with the appropriate package to fix this error. "],["intro-markdown.html", "5 Intro to R Markdown", " 5 Intro to R Markdown As you may have learned already from section 6 of the Biology Procedures and Guidelines resource, R Markdown is a markup language that provides an easy way to produce a rich, fully-documented reproducible analysis. It allows its user to share a single file that contains all of the commentary, R code, and metadata needed to reproduce the analysis from beginning to end. R Markdown allows for “chunks” of R code to be included along with Markdown text to produce a nicely formatted HTML, PDF, or Word file without having to know any complicated programming languages or having to fuss with getting the formatting just right in a Microsoft Word DOCX file. One R Markdown file can generate a variety of different formats and all of this is done in a single text file with a few bits of formatting. You’ll be pleasantly surprised at how easy it is to write an R Markdown document after your first few attempts. We will be using R Markdown to create reproducible lab reports. Note R Markdown is just one flavour of a markup language. RStudio can be used to edit R Markdown. There are many other markdown editors out there, but using RStudio is good for our purposes. "],["lit-programming.html", "5.1 Literate programming with R Markdown", " 5.1 Literate programming with R Markdown View the following short video: Why use R Markdown for Lab Reports? The preceding video described what can be referred to as literate programming: authoring a single document that integrates data analysis (executable code) with textual documentation, linking data, code, and text. In R Markdown, the executable R code is placed in “chunks,” and these are embedded throughout sections of regular text. For an example of an HTML (webpage) document that illustrates the effectiveness of literate programming, take a look at this HTML output - a webpage that accompanied a lab-based experiment examining the potential for freshwater diatoms to be successfully dispersed over long distances adhered to duck feathers.

A key functionality we need is being able to “knit” our report to PDF format. For this, we need to install the tinytex package {#install_tinytex}. Copy and paste the following two lines of code into the command console of RStudio (the bottom left window panel), then press return: install.packages(&quot;tinytex&quot;) tinytex::install_tinytex() RStudio will take a minute or two to install a bunch of things. Once it’s done, we’re ready to try knitting to PDF! Reminder Recall you only need to install a package once! And this should be the last time you need to deal with the tinytex package (you won’t need to “load” it in future), because now that it’s installed, its functionality works in the background with RStudio. While in RStudio, select the “+” dropdown icon at top left of RStudio window, and select R Markdown. RStudio may at this point install a bunch of things, and if so that’s ok. A window will then appear and you can replace the “Untitled” with something like “Test,” then select OK. This will open an R Markdown document in the top left panel. Don’t worry about all the text in there at this point. What we want to do is test whether it will “knit” (render) the document to PDF format. To do this: Select the “Knit” drop-down icon near the top left of the RStudio window, and select “Knit to PDF.” RStudio will ask you to first save the markdown file (save it anywhere with any name for now), then it will process the markdown file and render it to PDF. In a future tutorial we’ll discuss how to use R Markdown as part of a reproducible workflow.

In first year you learned from the Biology program’s introductory Open Science learning modules that reproducible research studies are not as common as one might assume. One key reason for this is insufficient documentation of all the steps taken along the research workflow. Moreover, conducting reproducible research is extremely challenging - more than most scientists appreciate. See, for example, an incredible, recent case concerning ageing experiments with C. elegans here. In the BIOL202 lectures you’ll learn more about the various causes of irreproducible research, and about the practices that can help promote reproducibility. In this lab component of the course, you’ll learn the basics of how to achieve an acceptable level of computational reproducibility (complete computational reproducibility is actually pretty tricky, but we’ll get close). "],["comp-repro.html", "7.1 Computational reproducibility", " 7.1 Computational reproducibility Almost all research, whether it’s conducted in the field or in a lab, includes a substantial amount of work that’s done on the computer. This includes data processing, statistical analyses, data visualization and presentation, and production of research outputs (e.g. publications). Some research is of course exclusively conducted on computers. The bottom line is that computer-based work forms a key and substantive part of all research workflows. Given that this work is done on computers (which are entirely controllable), it should be able to be reproduced exactly. This is known as computational reproducibility: an independent researcher should be able to access all data and scripts from a study, run those scripts, and get exactly the same outputs and results as reported in the original study. In this tutorial you’ll start gaining relevant experience and skills by producing a reproducible lab report. Note A workflow refers to the the steps you take when conducting your day-to-day work - say, on a term project, for example. Having a well-designed workflow improves efficiency, and when done right, reproducibility. It includes, for example, how you create, access, and manage files on your computer (or in the cloud). Following best practices for naming and organizing your files and directories on your computer will help ensure that you can spend more time doing the important work, and less time fiddling and trying to remember what you did and where you saved your work. It will also help your future self, when labs and assignments in upper year courses request that you use R and R Markdown for analyses and reports. Review the Biology department’s Procedures and Guidelines webpage description of how to manage files and directories. This should take about 20 minutes "],["biol202-workflow.html", "8 An example BIOL202 workflow", " 8 An example BIOL202 workflow Now that you have reviewed the fundamentals of file and directory management, you should decide how to best organize and manage the work you do for BIOL202. Here we’ll provide one example approach that most if not all of you will find useful. "],["onedrive.html", "8.1 Microsoft OneDrive", " 8.1 Microsoft OneDrive Our suggested approach assumes you have set up a Microsoft account through UBC (using your CWL), and have set up the OneDrive application on your own computer, which automatically syncs (when you’re online) selected files/directories between your local computer and your OneDrive account in the cloud. Why OneDrive? As a UBC student, you receive 1TB of free storage! And you also get peace of mind knowing that your files are secure and up-to-date (provided you have an internet connection), and that OneDrive has something called “version control,” which saves old versions of files and allows you to see those versions if you wish, so long as you maintain the same file name. WAIT A SECOND! In the “File Naming” instructions that I just reviewed, I was instructed to create a new file with a new version number in the filename (e.g. with a “V0,” “V1,” “V2” etc…) each time I worked on it! Those instructions are entirely valid! However, when you have access to a version control system, like OneDrive, it is better to keep the file name the same, rather than changing it each time you update it. For example, your markdown file (which as a “.Rmd” extension to the name) that you use for your tutorial work should maintain the same name throughout the term, rather than saving a new file each time you do substantive work on it. Assuming your files are syncing properly between your computer and OneDrive (and this simply requires that you’re connected to the internet), you will always be able to see (and if desired, restore) old versions of your files. If you haven’t set up OneDrive yet, follow the instructions provided at this UBC IT website. Note Using OneDrive is entirely optional. If you choose not to use OneDrive, please follow the file naming instructions from the Procedures and Guidelines document. And you can still follow the directory structure instructions below, regardless of where you set up your directories (OneDrive or not). "],["dir-structure.html", "8.2 Directory structure", " 8.2 Directory structure We anticipate three general categories of work being undertaken: Lecture work, including annotating lecture notes (e.g. on PDFs or PowerPoints) and writing study notes of your own (e.g. using Word) Tutorial work, including practicing what you learn in tutorials using RStudio and R Markdown, and commenting about tips, or tricky bits Lab assignment work, in which you answer questions using R and R Markdown and create a document for submission and grading Each of these categories of work should have their own directory, and all three of these directories should exist within a “root” directory called “BIOL202.” "],["setup-dirs.html", "8.3 Steps to set up directories", " 8.3 Steps to set up directories Having successfully installed OneDrive, you should see a “OneDrive” folder on your computer In your OneDrive folder, create a root directory “BIOL202” to host all of your BIOL202 work Create a \"_README.txt file for the root BIOL202 directory, as per instructions in the Biology Procedures and Guidelines webpage. TIP You can create and edit your \"_README.txt\" file in RStudio! Just click on the “+” drop down at the top left, and select “Text file.” Then type in the information you need, and name it \"_README.txt\" and save it in the appropriate directory. Within the BIOL202 root directory, create three (sub)directories: “BIOL202_lecture” “BIOL202_tutorials” “BIOL202_assignments” Create a \"_README.txt\" file in each of the three sub-directories (again, you can use RStudio to create these!) The BIOL202 directory, and all its contents, will now sync regularly to your online OneDrive account, so that you can access your up-to-date files from any device upon which OneDrive is installed.

"],["tutorial-workflow.html", "8.5 Tutorial workflow", " 8.5 Tutorial workflow How you manage your tutorial workflow comes down to personal preference. The instructions provided below create an RStudio project in the “BIOL202_tutorials” directory (see below), and then create a single R Markdown document, formatted to have sections (headers) for each tutorial you work on. This approach makes it easier to find all of your work in the R Markdown file, so long as it is formatted logically. I have created an R Markdown file that you can download and use for this purpose, and we’ll download that a bit later. First, we need to set up an RStudio project. "],["create-project.html", "8.6 Create an RStudio Project", " 8.6 Create an RStudio Project It is best to organize all your R work using RStudio “projects.” For your tutorial work, for example, you will create a new project that will be housed in your “BIOL202_tutorials” directory To do this, open RStudio then select File &gt; New Project. Then select the option to use an existing directory, and locate and select your tutorial directory. Provide a name for your project file, such as “BIOL202_tutorial,” then select OK. If it asks to open a new RStudio session, you can say yes. RStudio has now created an RStudio project file that has an “Rproj” extension at the end of the name. This “Rproj” file is the file that you will open (double-click with the mouse) each time you wish to work on your tutorial material. You should see the “Rproj” file in the bottom right files panel of RStudio. "],["create-subdirs.html", "8.7 Create subdirectories", " 8.7 Create subdirectories Your tutorial work may involve creating and saving outputs like figures or files, in which case you should have sub-directories for these purposes in your root directory. See the example provided in the Procedures and Guidelines document. Let’s illustrate the procedure by creating a subdirectory called “figures,” and this time we’ll use R to create the directory. Updated 7:15pm Sept 9 The following code will create a directory called “figures” in your working directory dir.create(&quot;figures&quot;) You should see the new folder appear in the files panel on the bottom right of RStudio. Whenever you wish to generate figures in R, then export them as image files, for example, you can save them to this folder. We’ll learn about this later. Reading and writing files from / to directories requires that we can tell R exactly where to find those directories. That’s where the handy package called here comes in. 8.7.1 The here package Now we’ll install and load an R package called here that will help with file and directory management and navigation. This is a helpful blog post about the utility of the here package. The necessary code lines are as follows: install.packages(&quot;here&quot;) library(here) When you load the library, the here function takes stock of where your RStudio project file is located, and establishes that directory as the “working directory.” It should return a file path for you. In future tutorials we’ll make use of the here package when saving files. "],["edit-markdown.html", "8.8 Edit an R markdown file", " 8.8 Edit an R markdown file In a previous tutorial you learned how to create an R Markdown file, but generally you won’t need to do this in this course, because you’ll be provided starter documents to work with. I have created an R Markdown file that you can download and use for starting your tutorial work. To do this, copy and paste the following code into your command console in RStudio (the bottom left panel), and press return: download.file(&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ubco-biology/BIOL202/main/more/Example_tutorial_markdown.Rmd&quot;, &quot;BIOL202_tutorial_markdown.Rmd&quot;) This download.file command takes a URL address for a file stored online, and then tells R where to save it, and what name to use.

Click on the \"BIOL202_tutorial_markdown.Rmd file to open it. This is the R Markdown file that you’ll edit/add to throughout the term. It has some starting instructions / example text already, and you’re welcome to delete / change that. Change the “author” information at the top of the document (in the header) to your name.

You can insert as many chunks as you’d like. Chunk insertion is achieved by selecting the green “+” icon at top of the editor panel, and selecting “R.” Or go to the “Code” menu drop down and “Insert Chunk.” The key advice: keep your work organized by using headings.

You can optionally create subdirectories also, perhaps one for each of the lab assignments. The key difference in the assignments workflow is that for each assignment you’ll start with a new R Markdown (Rmd) file, which you’ll download from Canvas under the “assignments” link.

You may have also created sub-directories, one for each of the three assignments. Regardless, in your root “BIOL202_assignments” directory locate the RStudio project file (it has a “Rproj” extension in the filename), and open it by double-clicking it. Download the assignment Rmd file The assignment file will be available to you for download from Canvas. Locate the assignment there. The file is actually an R Markdown file, and therefore has an “Rmd” extension. It is simply a text document (meaning it contains only text), but the syntax used therein is “markdown” syntax, and the file extension (Rmd) specifies it as an R Markdown file. You might recall reading about Markdown in the Biology Procedures and Guidelines document. Make sure you save the Rmd file into your root “BIOL202_assignments” directory, or alternatively into the appropriate sub-directory. A practice assignment has been set up on Canvas, so that you can get used to this procedure. It is located under “Lab_materials” module. Download the file, and make sure it’s saved into your root directory (where your RStudio project is). Open the assignment Rmd file In RStudio, look in the “files” pane (bottom right) and locate your downloaded assignment Rmd file. Then click it to open. This Markdown document includes the assignment questions, and serves as a starter document for your assignment. Once you have opened the document, you’ll see the following text at the top: Assignment header Do the following steps: keeping the quotation marks, replace the “Practice assignment” text with the current assignment name (unless you’re doing the practice assignment, in which case do not change anything!) keeping the quotation marks, replace the “Firstname Lastname, Section YY” with your own Firstname Lastname and section number (e.g. \" Jason Pither, Section 04\") keeping the quotation marks, replace the “Due date” with the due date of the current assignment, e.g. “November 3, 2021” NOTE Don’t alter anything else at the top of the document, including the R Chunk that you see below the header. save the Rmd file using a new name (so select file &gt; “save as”), according to appropriate file naming conventions, such as “Pither_BIOL202_practice.Rmd.” Recall that if you’re saving this on OneDrive, or in your local directory that is synced to OneDrive, then your file will be version controlled. You’re now ready to start working on your assignment, and doing literate programming using R Markdown. REMINDER In RStudio, under the “Help” menu, you’ll find “Cheat Sheets” &gt; R Markdown Cheat Sheet and R Markdown Reference Guide. Have a look at those! What to include in your answers The general approach is to enter your text answers and associated R chunks with code underneath each question. Tip It is almost always the case that you’ll need to load the tidyverse package, so it’s advisable to include an R chunk right at the beginning of your document that does this. Tip To insert a new code chunk, you can either: * Use the shortcut: Mac = Command+Option+I; Windows = Ctrl+Alt+I. * Click on the Insert a new code chunk icon. You can also change specify the coding language of the chunk using the drop-down menu. Code chunk headers Here’s an example code chunk in which the tidyverse package is being loaded. You’ll notice some extra text in the header of the chunk. Install packges R Chunk header The “load_packages” text is simply giving a name or “tag” to this R chunk. It is good practice to provide a unique name to each R chunk. After the comma is message = F. This tells R markdown to NOT display any messages associated with the R commands in this chunk when knitting the R Markdown document. For example, when loading some libraries R will provide a long list of messages in the process. When you “knit” the R Markdown document, R will run each R chunk in your document. By including the message = F heading argument, you can avoid including this extra output in your knitted document. There will be routine steps to take for each question. Import data Each assignment question will indicate which dataset(s) you’ll need to answer the question, and where to locate / download these. In many instances multiple questions will use the same dataset, in which case you don’t need to load data for each question; just load it once. Here’s an example of code for importing data. It uses the read_csv function from the readr package, which is bundled with the tidyverse package: example_data &lt;- read_csv(&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ubco-biology/BIOL202/main/data/example_data.csv&quot;) The read_csv function will take as an argument a URL address for a data file. Here we’ve provided a ULR for the location of a CSV file (comma-separated values file), which is typically what we’ll use. Load packages Once you’ve loaded the data, you’ll now need to figure out how to answer the question by looking through the tutorials for the answer. And typically, to answer the question you’ll need to make sure you’ve loaded some packages. If you’ve forgotten what “packages” are, refresh your memory at this tutorial. For example, it’s likely you’ve already loaded the tidyverse package (as advised above), but if a tutorial indicates you need another package, say the janitor package, then insert a code chunk with the following: library(janitor) REMINDER When working on your own computer, you only need to install a package once (unless you want to update an already installed package to the latest version, which is a rare event). If you’re working on a school computer (in a computer lab), you may need to install packages each time you log on to a computer, because the school computers delete local files daily. If you’re unsure what packages are already installed, consult the “packages” tab in the lower-right RStudio pane when you start up RStudio; installed packages are listed there. Answer the questions After you’ve imported the required data and loaded required packages, it’s time to answer the questions! You simply insert any required text and R code (in R Chunks) after each question. The tutorials will provide the information required to answer the questions. TIP The way to test out your code once it’s inserted in the R chunk is to press the green play button at the top right of the code chunk. This will run what’s in the chunk. You’ll be provided error statements if something goes wrong. If it works, it will provide you the output (and hopefully the answer!), and this is what you use to inform your written (typed) answer. Here’s what you need to include in your answers: Answer each question clearly and in full sentences. Make sure you answer specifically the question asked. Verify that the code you used to answer the question is included in an R chunk and appears in the knitted document (this should happen automatically) Verify that the output from each R chunk is included in your knitted document (this should happen automatically) For any figures (graphs) that you produce, you must include a figure caption. A future tutorial will show you how. If you use a graph to answer a question, refer to that graph in your answer REMINDER As you work on your document, save frequently, and also knit your document frequently. TIP You will often need/want to preview the document you are working on to ensure that everything is being formatted as you expected in the knitting process. The default setting is for the preview to open in a new pop-up window outside of RStudio, although you may find it useful to have it open in the Viewer panel within RStudio itself (particularly if you’re only working with one screen!). To change the preview location, click the Settings icon in the toolbar and select the option to “Preview in Viewer Pane.” Example question / answer Below is an example of how to answer a question. NOTE There are almost always multiple coding approaches to get the right answer, some better than others. As long as your code and answer are accurate and make sense, you’ll get the marks! Question 1. What are the minimum and maximum heights (variable name is “height_cm”) of students in the “students” dataset, which is available at this URL: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ubco-biology/BIOL202/main/data/students2.csv Example Answer 1 I’ll first download and import the dataset: As we learned in the [fictitious] “importing and exploring data” tutorial, we can use the summary function to get some basic descriptive statistics, including the minimum and maximum of numeric variables. The summary function is part of the base R package, so no additional packages need to be loaded. students %&gt;% summary ## height_cm head_circum_cm Sex Number_of_siblings Dominant_hand Dominant_foot Dominant_eye ## Min. :150.0 Min. :21.00 Length:154 Min. :0.000 Length:154 Length:154 Length:154 ## 1st Qu.:165.0 1st Qu.:55.52 Class :character 1st Qu.:1.000 Class :character Class :character Class :character ## Median :171.5 Median :57.00 Mode :character Median :2.000 Mode :character Mode :character Mode :character ## Mean :172.0 Mean :56.04 Mean :1.708 ## 3rd Qu.:180.0 3rd Qu.:58.50 3rd Qu.:2.000 ## Max. :210.8 Max. :63.00 Max. :6.000 As shown in the output above, the minimum height was 150.0 cm and the maximum student height was 210.8 cm. Example Answer 2 I’ll first download and import the dataset: As we learned in the [fictitious] “describing data” tutorial, we can use the summarise function from the dplyr package (which comes with the tidyverse package) to get basic descriptive statistics for numeric variables in a dataset. students %&gt;% summarise(min.height= min(height_cm, na.rm = T), max.height = max(height_cm, na.rm = T)) ## # A tibble: 1 x 2 ## min.height max.height ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 150 211. As shown in the output above, the minimum height was 150.0 cm and the maximum student height was 210.8 cm. Knitting your assignment to PDF All assignments are to be submitted to Canvas as PDF documents. As you learned in a previous tutorial, simply click on the “knit” button and select PDF. Your PDF file will adopt the same name as your markdown file, but it will have a “pdf” extension rather than an “Rmd” extension. Once you have knitted your assignment to PDF, open up the PDF document, and verify that it looks correct, and be sure to check all your spelling, and that figures / tables are appropriately formatted etc… If you need to fix something, close your PDF file, go back to your R Markdown document and do the edits there. Save, then knit again! Setting up R Markdown for graphing There are some special code chunk header arguments that need to be set in your Markdown document in order to: include proper Figure captions with your figures (a necessity!) set the dimensions of your figures In each code chunk that includes code to construct a graph, your chunk header options should look like this in the top of the chunk, and there should be one blank line underneath before the main code starts. The following chunk produced the figure below. And recall that in the example below, the “bill_fig” text is simply the name I’ve given to this code chunk. {r bill_fig, fig.cap = &quot;Histogram of bill depth among 151 Adelie penguins&quot;, fig.width = 4, fig.height = 4} penguins %&gt;% filter(species == &quot;Adelie&quot;) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(bill_depth_mm)) + geom_histogram(color = &quot;lightgrey&quot;) knitr::include_graphics(&quot;./more/example_histogram_practice.png&quot;) The key parts are the “fig.cap =” argument, to which you provide the text you want to use as the figure caption. Then there’s the “fig.width =” and “fig.height =” arguments, which indicate the size of the figure when knitted. This will likely require some trial-and-error to get a good size, but start with the values in this example (4 for each). Automated figure numbering When you knit the document to PDF, you’ll see the “Figure X:” (with a number in place of the “X”) text was appended at the beginning of the caption phrase that was included in the chunk header, “Histogram of bill depth among 151 Adelie penguins.” This feature - automatic figure numbering - was set within the header of the assignment markdown document: Assignment header The line “fig_caption = TRUE” tells R Markdown and the knitting process to automatically include this part of a figure caption, “Figure X,” underneath each figure you produce. Where “X” will automatically be replaced with the appropriate number. For example, it will use “Figure 1:” for your first figure, “Figure 2” for your second, and so on. Submit your assignment Once you’re happy with the PDF you created, it’s time to submit your PDF document to the appropriate place in Canvas. It’s a good idea also to verify afterwards that your PDF document did indeed upload correctly.

Toolbar The tool you want is the one on the far-right in the picture above. NOTE The visual editor with reformat your source code using Pandoc’s default markdown writer, so it may look slightly different when you toggle back to source view. For many, the VME will feel much more familiar and use-friendly the the ‘traditional’ Markdown source editing. Highlights of this new feature include: Real-time spell-checking and outline navigation. Tight integration with source editing (editing location and undo/redo state are preserved when switching between modes). Keyboard support. In addition to traditional shortcuts, you can use markdown expressions (e.g. ##, bold, etc.) for formatting. If you don’t remember all of the keyboard shortcuts, you can also use the catch-all ⌘ / shortcut to insert anything. Extensive support for citations, including integration with Zotero and the ability to insert citations from DOIs or searches of PubMed, Crossref, and DataCite. Scientific and technical writing features, including cross-references, footnotes, equations, code execution, and embedded LaTeX.
